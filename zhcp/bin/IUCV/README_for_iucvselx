On Rhel7 or later system, when SELINUX works in "Enforcing" status, IUCV
communication between daemon and client will can't work well.

This file is used to describe:
1. How to generated selinux policy files to allow IUCV communication.
2. How to set the iucv policy file in the same directory to the target guest.
3. The difference of iucv policy file between new deployed system and a running system.


1. How to generated selinux policy files to allow IUCV communication.
   User need to install policycoreutils-devel on the rhel7 or later target system which selinux
   works in "Enforcing" mode.  

   Generate the iucvselx(_running).te file, which is source file of .pp.
   Run command on an openstack newly deployed VM: 
   "grep iucvserv /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -m iucvselx > iucvselx.te"
   and run command on an existing running system
   "grep iucvserv /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -m iucvselx_running > iucvselx_running.te"

   Generate the iucvselx(_running).pp file, which is the policy file.
   Run command on an openstack newly deployed VM.
   "grep iucvserv /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M iucvselx.pp" 
   and run command on an existing running system.
   "grep iucvserv /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M iucvselx_running.pp"

2. How to set the iucv policy file in the same directory to the target guest.
   Run command "semodule -i iucvselx.pp" or "semodule -i iucvselx_running.pp"on the target system.

3. The difference of iucv policy file between new deployed system and a running system. 
   When the system are newly deployed, iucv related files are copyed by xcatconf4z at the system init stage,
   iucv process work in init_t domain.
   For an existing running system, use "scp" to copy file to target guest, iucv process work in unconfined_service_t
   domain.
   So two policy files are needed to handle different scenarios.
