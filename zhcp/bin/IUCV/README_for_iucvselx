On RHEL7 or later system, when SElinux works in "Enforcing" mode, IUCV communication between
daemon and client is not allowed. For SLES and Ubuntu system, as SELINUX is not installed by
default, no tests are made on them.

This file describes:
1. How to generate the SELinux policy files to allow IUCV communication.
2. How to install the proper SELinux policy in the correct directory on the IUCV target guest.
3. The difference between the SELinux policy file that is for newly deployed xCAT guests
   and existing guest.


1. How to generate the SELinux policy files to allow IUCV communication.
   User need to install policycoreutils-devel on the RHEL7 or later target system which SElinux
   works in "Enforcing" mode.

   Generate the iucvselx(_running).te file, which is the source file of .pp file.
   Run command on an openstack newly deployed VM:
   "grep iucvserv /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -m iucvselx > iucvselx.te"
   and run command on an existing running system
   "grep iucvserv /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -m iucvselx_running > iucvselx_running.te"

   Generate the iucvselx(_running).pp file, which is the SElinux policy file for IUCV daemon.
   Run command on an openstack newly deployed VM.
   "grep iucvserv /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M iucvselx.pp"
   and run command on an existing running system.
   "grep iucvserv /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M iucvselx_running.pp"

2. How to install the proper SELinux policy in the correct directory on the IUCV target guest.
   Run command "semodule -i iucvselx.pp" or "semodule -i iucvselx_running.pp"on the target system.

3. The difference between the SELinux policy file that is for newly deployed xCAT guests and existing
   guest.
   When the system are newly deployed, IUCV related files are copied by xcatconf4z at the system init
   stage, IUCV daemon process works in init_t domain.
   For an existing running system, use "scp" to copy file to the target guest, IUCV daemon process works
   in unconfined_service_t domain.
   So two policy files are needed to handle different scenarios.
